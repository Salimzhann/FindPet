Pet Reunion: Lost & Found Pet Matching App
Project Overview
Pet Reunion is a mobile application designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners. Using advanced image recognition technology and location-based services, the app allows users to report lost pets, search for found pets that match their criteria, and communicate directly with other users through an integrated chat system.
This app addresses a critical problem for pet owners: according to the American Humane Association, approximately 10 million pets are lost in the United States each year. Pet Reunion aims to significantly improve the chances of reuniting owners with their lost companions.
Features

Lost & Found Pet Listings: View and manage listings of both lost and found pets

Real-time Chat: Communicate directly with other users about potential matches
User Profiles: Manage your account and preferences
Pet Management: Add and manage information about your pets
Location-based Services: Find pets near your location
Verification System: Email verification to ensure legitimate users
